                            <p>Nuclear power is not necessary for the Australian grid, which can be powered by 100% renewables
                        swiftly, cheaply and effectively. Fusion has no intent to subsidise or otherwise encourage
                        nuclear fission power, but supports repealing section 140A(1)b of the Environmental Protection
                        Act (1999) and amending the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act (1998) to
                        allow nuclear fusion research.</p>

                    <h4 id="disaster-response">Disaster response</h4>
                    <p>The bushfires of summer 2020â€“21 and recent flooding in NSW and Queensland have shown us how
                        unprepared our government is to deal with climate-driven disasters in the immediate, short and
                        longer term. Fusion will properly fund advisory and response entities that can help minimise the
                        impact of these disasters when they occur, including purchase of the water bombers we are still
                        waiting for.</p>

                    <h4 id="child-care-costs">Child-care costs</h4>
                    <p>In line with Fusion's <a href="https://www.fusionparty.org.au/education_for_life">Education for
                        Life</a> position, we stand for quality, affordable child care for all Australians. Lack of
                        available and affordable child care disproportionately limits women from returning to work.
                        Choosing to work should provide the parent some financial incentive, and not just a little bit
                        extra after paying child care costs. And all children should have the opportunity to benefit
                        from quality child care. Free childcare for income eligible households with a sliding scale for
                        those earning more has the potential to expand the workforce as more parents choose to return to
                        work and provide a great educational start for all children (read more <a
                                href="https://australiainstitute.org.au/report/participating-in-growth-free-childcare-and-increased-participation/">here</a>).
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="industrial-relations">Industrial relations</h4>
                    <p>In line with Fusion's Fair and Inclusive Society position, Fusion fully supports the right of
                        workers to formally organise in order to bargain with employers. The rights of all working
                        people must be upheld. Extra effort is required to redress the imbalance for those in casual
                        employment or the gig economy. Fusion recognises that workers should be paid more for working
                        weekends and evenings and night shifts.</p>
                    <p>We support the award system and the right of a worker to withdraw their labour in a dispute with
                        their employer and not face the sack or be fined as a result of formal strike action. We support
                        the right for unions to hold secret ballots for member decisions.</p>
                    <h4 id="indue-card">Indue Card</h4>
                    <p>Fusion strongly opposes forcing people who receive income support onto cashless welfare. This
                        card removes agency, and is unreliable as a payment method. Cashless welfare initially underwent
                        a policy trial which was badly designed and for which the results were inconclusive, and yet the
                        government expanded the trial, claiming the trial was successful. Indue cards centralise control
                        of money â€“ a private company could cancel or block cards at any time. However, any Centrelink
                        recipient should have the option to receive their benefits via a cashless welfare card.</p>
                    <h4 id="voting-rights">Voting rights</h4>
                    <p>Fusion supports lowering the option to vote to 16 years. The obligation to vote would not begin
                        till 18 years. Electoral education would also be introduced to the high school curriculum.</p>
                    <img class="rounded w-100 mb-3" src="https://fusionparty.space/images/children_at_window_200.webp" alt="Children looking out a window">
                    <h4 id="vaccines">Vaccines</h4>
                    <p>Vaccines should be free and readily available. Vaccination mandates to work in caring professions
                        are acceptable to protect public health and the vulnerable.
                    </p>
                    <h4 id="drug-reform">Drug reform</h4>
                    <p>Fusion supports legalisation of cannabis, controlled and excised much the same way that alcohol
                        is regulated.</p>
                    <p>Fusion provisionally supports legalisation of other currently controlled substances. Prohibition
                        of specific substances has failed to minimise harms to individuals, communities and the
                        economy.</p>
                    <p>Fusion proposes a model of harm minimisation based on that implemented by Portugal, where
                        decriminalisation has provided net benefits to society as a whole. The Portuguese model includes
                        no advertising of relevant substances and tax revenue resulting.</p>
                    <p>Fusion sees this as shifting issues from the Police and Courts to Health Care, reducing
                        opportunities for police corruption and underworld violence, as well as improving quality
                        control, and alleviating many of the social ills created by classifying specific substances as
                        illicit.</p>

                    <p>Australia has the most concentrated media ownership in the OECD. In line with our <a
                            href="https://www.fusionparty.org.au/ethical_governance">Ethical Governance</a> position,
                        Fusion supports the reintroduction of <a
                                href="https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BriefingBook46p/MediaBroadcasting">stronger
                            media ownership laws</a> that cap ownership share by any one corporation.</p>
                    <p>Fusion supports restoring ABC and SBS funding. ABC alone has lost over 1,000 jobs over the past
                        decade. ABC is well suited to provide additional regional news broadcasts and imperative for
                        incubating local talent.</p>
                    <p>Fusion supports that any Australian news service should be properly regulated and held to account
                        for misleading or false reporting. Fusion also supports a Royal Commission establishment of such
                        a Royal Commission to ensure the strength and diversity of Australian news media.</p>

                    <p>Government is the ideal provider for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Essential services that should be available to all rather than on a user-pays basis (e.g.
                            health care, education, job search services)
                        </li>
                        <li>Large IT projects where government services already hold private personal data (e.g.
                            electronic health records)
                        </li>
                        <li>Natural monopolies, where the barrier to entry is so high as to prevent market competition
                            (e.g. the electricity grid).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In some cases, it is likely in government interests to re-acquire or partially re-acquire certain
                        assets, such as the national grid, where sound governance of the whole system is of the utmost
                        importance as we transition to a zero-carbon grid.
