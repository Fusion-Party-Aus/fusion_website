                <h2 class="h-underline h-pink mb-2 mt-3" id="why-have-these-principles-">Why have these Principles?</h2>
                <p>While <a href="/our_values"><em>values</em></a> are the foundation for working together, it's the
                    <em>principles</em>
                    that captures the overall approach for a particular policy area. This is the bridge to the specific
                    methods that can then be detailed - which are the <em>policies</em>.</p>
                <h4 id="what-does-this-do-for-us-">What does this do for us?</h4>
                <p>The more we can clarify the thinking behind our policies, the better positioned we are to create new
                    policies which feel consistent. Our constituents can more easily understand what we're likely to do,
                    and we're rapidly able to address new societal issues as they emerge. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If we are suddenly asked about our position on a new issue, we want to be saying less of “we
                        don't have a policy on that”, and more “based on our values of X, Y and Z, we would probably be
                        in favour of supporting / rejecting this practice”.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The first of those is unsatisfying, and the latter can be <em>very difficult</em> - since if we're
                    being asked the question, the linkage to the Values is probably not-obvious.</p>
                <p>The Principles allow us to more easily align the outcomes of a policy we're being asked about with
                    the goals and approaches that have already been derived from the values - allowing us to more
                    confidently support or reject a proposed policy on Principle, with ready-made explanations for
                    why.</p>
                <h4 id="how-do-these-work-">How do these work?</h4>
                <p>In order to define the link between a Principle and a specific Value, there should be two
                    elements:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>An implication/outcome of <em>the Principle</em>, that demonstrates alignment with the Value.
                    </li>
                    <li>An implication/outcome that shows how <em>not</em> abiding by the Principle would explicitly
                        violate the Value.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Subsequently a Principle should follow the general structure of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Core Explanation of the Principle</li>
                    <li>Defining Values and their Linkage Justification</li>
                    <li>Subsequent Implications, Clarifications, &amp; Context</li>
                    <li>Implications on Actual or Potential Focus Areas of Fusion (examples, not exhaustive)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In cases where we want to campaign on a holistic policy focus area, that focus area should ideally be
                    accompanied by a diagram of how applicable Values flow into multiple Principles, and then how those
                    subsequently flow through into a single Focus.</p>
                <p>Any focus areas that are the explicit domains of a particular branch, if applicable, should have an
                    accompanying diagram for communication purposes.</p>
                <p><em>For ease of understanding, the Principles have been grouped under general headings.
                    General headings are not inputs to the structure, they are just descriptive labels.</em>
                </p>
                <h2 class="h-underline h-pink mb-2" id="steering-government">Steering Government</h2>
                <br/>
                <p>Government is inescapable. Famously, this fact led to the quote "Nothing is certain but death and
                    taxes."
                    The best escape we can hope for then is that government does its job so well that most of us never
                    need to
                    worry about it messing up our lives. These principles seek to ensure government is effective and
                    efficient,
                    and that systems developed to achieve this are resilient against crisis, stupidity, and bad
                    actors.</p>

                                        afterwards so that successive governments cannot exploit it for other

                                        underscores their perspective
                                        on what they do, and can cause significant difference of opinion between people
                                        who otherwise agree
                                        on the goals being pursued. A person may, consciously or unconsciously, believe
                                        in multiple roles of
                                        government, but it is the core role which will define their positions on what is
                                        considered
                                        acceptable use of government authority.</p>
                                    <p>In this case we are specifically talking about what the people who make up the

                                        their role is with respect to the populace, <em>not</em> what their supporters
                                        think is the role of
                                        the government. This distinction is key because, while the sentiment can go both
                                        ways, one can only
                                        set readily definable objectives in one direction.</p>
                                    <p>i.e. This is not, &quot;What do People who vote Liberal think the role is?&quot;
                                        but instead, &quot;What
                                        do the Liberal Party MP's think their role is?&quot; (Swap in any other party

                                        shapes interactions by defining how resources are allocated, how transactions

                                        economic decisions are made. A focus on advancing inclusive institutions ensures

                                                institutions are crucial because they act as a counterweight to the

                                        policies to meet the needs of a changing world, ensuring that public education
                                        remains a powerful
                                        tool for personal and societal advancement. It demands an adaptive curriculum
                                        that incorporates
                                        current knowledge and technologies. It also tackles the ongoing issue of
                                        educational inequality,
                                        emphasising reforms that ensure all students receive access to a comparable
                                        level of education. It
                                        also requires employing more ESOs, administrators, special education teachers,
                                        counsellors and other
                                        positions that support the education environment, so that teachers are freed up

                                        jobs. We cannot expect teachers to keep up with an adaptive curriculum and
                                        maintain their own
                                        personal and professional development without freeing them up to focus on doing
                                        so. Too much is
                                        currently expected of the role.</p>
                                    <p>A notable consequence if free public education is extended to effective tertiary
                                        education, is that
                                        the incentivisation of study pathways cannot be utilised as a method of
                                        inflating workforce numbers
                                        in an area - the corollary of which is that the only way to inflate a workforce
                                        that is lagging, is
                                        to consider the conditions and benefits of that work. One cannot be disconnected
                                        from that reality
                                        with delusions about the effectiveness of alternative incentivisation.</p>

                                                protects individuals from preventable health issues and provides the

                                                can lead to
                                                greater public health risk and societal harm, and increased health risks

                                        community and stakeholder engagement. Engaging with affected communities is
                                        essential for both
                                        understanding the nuances of systemic barriers and for crafting effective
                                        solutions that don't
                                        simply result in different barriers arising.</p>
                                    <p>This principle recognises the profound impact of systemic barriers on individual
                                        lives and societal
                                        health, and it directs our actions towards creating a more equitable, free, and

                <p>From all of this there are a few details of <em>how</em> we'd go about doing things that are derived,
                    but are not obvious, from the Values and Principles above.</p>
                <p>These are noted here for general understanding:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consultation with experts will always be pursued in the development of any policy.</li>
                    <li>Policies for economic development will follow models of either facilitation or incentive, not of
                        subsidy.
                    </li>
                    <li>Community consultation for local issues is required for policies intended to address those
                        issues - including indigenous issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>Systemic fixes that address the root of a problem will be preferred compared to patch jobs
                        designed for short-term relief - especially in areas of tax, housing, and social justice.
