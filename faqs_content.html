<h3 class="h-underline h-pink">What are Fusion's core issues? How has Fusion developed a policy platform from its divergent constituent parties?</h3>
<p>Fusion has built a comprehensive policy platform on shared goals (see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fusionparty.org.au/our_values">here</a>) but Fusion is also strongly founded on four core policy platforms of each constituent party.</p>
<p>The values of Fusion's constituent parties are not divergent, but we all focus on different policy areas. To build a comprehensive policy platform, we uncovered our common policy positions but ensured each party was able to contribute their core specialties to the common platform. The whole process has involved deep discussions and information sharing.</p>
<h3 class="h-underline h-pink">Why don't you have an acknowledgement of country on your website?</h3>
<p>Despite the suggestions of Reconciliation Australia, Fusion is informed by consultation with First Nation's community representatives. Informed by these conversations, we reserve acknowledgements of country for direct personal interactions (such as meetings and events) where the expression of acknowledgement is in keeping with the spirit in which a welcome to country is intended.</p>
<h3 class="h-underline h-pink">Who does Fusion give their preferences to?</h3>
<p>Your preferences are your own! Changes to the preference regulations in the upper house mean that parties can no longer direct preferences to other candidates of their choosing, they can only recommend to voters how to preference other parties on the ballot. We typically provide these recommendations as how-to-vote cards before election day - in flyers and posted on our website.</p>
<p>Fusion will recommend preferences based on other candidates' alignment with our vision and principles. Fusion aligns with other parties that value action on the climate emergency, integrity in politics, pragmatic solutions to a stronger economy, justice, equity, and social responsibility.</p>
<p>It's fair to say that we do not regard the current government as good or effective, and have created the party to provide voters with an alternative that reflects their views.</p>
<p>For a one-minute rundown on how preferential votes are counted, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaE6MigXYdY">here</a>.<br />For Juice Media's summary on how preferential voting works, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bleyX4oMCgM">here</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h-underline h-pink">Aren't smaller parties just stealing votes from larger parties?</h3>
<p>In Australia we have preferential voting which actually means putting voting for a minor party as your top preference at #1 does NOT reduce the chances of parties placed lower on your preferences getting a seat.</p>
<h3 class="h-underline h-pink">What's Fusion's electoral strategy?</h3>
<p>Naturally, the immediate goal is to get members elected to help form a healthy cross-bench &ndash; any emerging party's best chance for this is the senate. The Party Integrity Bill was a huge hurdle for every emerging party to leap. It's no coincidence the Bill was passed and enacted just ahead of a federal election. For future elections we will have a better chance for a solid three year campaign in particular seats.</p>
<p>Even without getting elected, our stated policies will influence the actions of other parties candidates, and we will affect the outcome of the election via how-to-vote advice, and education for voters on important issues.</p>
<h3 class="h-underline h-pink">Why was Fusion created? Weren't there other parties you could join?</h3>
<p>We are articulating a new social, economic, and ecological and governance pathway for Australia. We didn't see this represented in any other party.</p>
<p>Fusion isn't just one political party, it's a combination of 5 parties. The '<a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6755">Party Integrity Bill</a>' - which required the parties re-register within three months with triple the minimum number of members became a catalyst for emerging progressive parties to come together on common values and align our respective priorities, while diversifying our scope and reach.</p>
<h3 class="h-underline h-pink">Why didn't Fusion just join the Greens or ALP?</h3>
<p>While many of the values held by Fusion's constituent parties mirror values of the Greens, and many of the executive have previously worked with the Greens and ALP, there are a number of reasons why we wouldn't just join forces with them.</p>
<p>Each Fusion constituent party, and Fusion as a whole, differs enough from the Greens in our core areas to warrant something different.</p>
<p>There is both a perception and reality that the Greens do not act pragmatically nor represent the majority of Australians &ndash; this means that without massive internal culture change,&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;a national awareness campaign, the Greens will not be an effective alternative to the current government and opposition &ndash; particularly in regional and rural electorates.</p>
<p>Among other things, the Greens do not have pragmatic policies on climate emergency mobilisation, urban planning, civil and digital liberties, and privacy.</p>
<h3 class="h-underline h-pink">What were you thinking with the name <em>Fusion: Science, Pirate, Secular, Climate Emergency</em>?</h3>
<p>A party name has to not only be noticeable on the ballot but also be recognisable to the members from the different parties when the Electoral Commission calls to confirm their membership. Faced with the ironically named 'Party Integrity Bill' we had to ensure all existing members of the five parties would get the message.</p>
<p>We think the full name <em>FUSION, Science, Pirate, Secular, Climate Emergency </em>is indeed noticeable on the ballot and while we had some reservations about the appeal, it already raised <a href="https://www.voteplanet.net/blog/new-healthy-party-salad-for-2022-fusion-science-pirate-secular-climate-emergency">eyebrows</a>, and when a political party is starting out, any press is good press.<br /><br /></p>
